# HuRa - Human Randomness
Add to the data by calling takeinputs!

This project is intended to predict what a human sees as random. If you ever play a playlist on shuffle
and it doesn't sound quite random, this will try to understand that.
HuRa will show a 4x4 pixel image and ask you if you think it looks random. 
HuRa then uses that data to classify what it thinks a human will see as random.

I plan to implement wave function collapse to create less random looking images but I need to create good rulesets.
