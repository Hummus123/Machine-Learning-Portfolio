## Particle Physics Particle Collision Data Project

This project uses linear regressors on the plotted points of data from particle collisions in particle colliders.
Demonstrates machine learning's use in the field of physics. It is more of a personal project as the teacher stopped us at some point but I continued with the data making
making it more digestable.
