## Wave Function Collapse

This is a project designed to emulate a wave function collapse algorithm in my own way. Instead of having a set ruleset I create a ruleset using the average probability of a type of square existing next
to another type.

Currently uses very rudementary method for creating a new image from an input one that only uses the probability and not a tile's superposition.
